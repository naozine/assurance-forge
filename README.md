# Assurance Forge - Safety Case Engineering Tool

Assurance Forge is an application that assists Safety Engineers with Safety Case development.
The tool uses SACM (Structured Assurance Case Metamodel).

## ✨ Vision

Assurance Forge aims to modernize safety case development by:

- Making safety cases easier to understand and navigate
- Ensuring credibility through SACM compliance
- Enabling AI-assisted improvement of assurance arguments using the SCCG (Safety Case Core Guidelines)
- Removing the burden of diagram maintenance through automatic layout
- Fully open source

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

### Model-driven, not drawing-driven
Users work with assurance content, not diagram layout.

- SACM XML is the source of truth
- Layout is automatically generated
- No manual positioning of nodes

### SACM-first approach
- The tool consumes and produces SACM 2.3 XML
- Internal structures closely follow SACM concepts

### AI as optional assistance
- Users provide their own AI provider
- No vendor lock-in

---

## 🚀 Current Scope (MVP)

- Load SACM XML files
- Visualize assurance cases in a GSN-like structure
- Automatic layout of assurance elements
- Inspect nodes and relationships
- AI-based suggestions (planned)

## 📦 Releases

Pre-built Windows binaries are published on the [Releases page](https://github.com/lasrod/assurance-forge/releases).

1. Download `assurance-forge.<version>-windows-x64.zip` from the latest release.
2. Unzip anywhere.
3. Run `assurance-forge.exe` from the extracted folder.

Each zip contains the executable, the `data/` sample files, `README.md`, and `LICENSE.md`.

Releases are currently Windows x64 only. To build on other platforms, see [Build Instructions](#build-instructions) below.

---
## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- [Visual Studio 2022 Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2022) (select "Desktop development with C++", includes CMake)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Tested with Visual Studio 2022 (v18), CMake 4.2.3, Git 2.53.

## Build Instructions

### 1. Open Developer Command Prompt

Launch "Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022" from the Start menu.

Or in cmd:

```cmd
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\2022\BuildTools\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"
```

### 2. Clone and Initialize Submodules

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd assurance-forge
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### 3. Configure and Build

```bash
cmake --preset default
cmake --build --preset release
```

### 4. Run the Application

```bash
build\Release\assurance-forge.exe
```

### 5. Run Tests

```bash
ctest --preset release
```

Or run the test executable directly:

```bash
build\Release\tests.exe
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Enter the path to a SACM XML file (default: `data/sample.sacm.xml`)
3. Click "Load" to parse and display the assurance case elements
4. Elements are color-coded by type:
   - Green: Claims (Goals)
   - Blue: Argument Reasoning (Strategies)
   - Orange: Artifacts and Evidence

## Sample Data

A minimal sample file is included at `data/sample.sacm.xml`.

## Troubleshooting

**"The CXX compiler identification is unknown"**
- Run from Developer Command Prompt for VS 2022, not regular PowerShell/cmd

**Build fails with missing DirectX headers**
- Install Windows SDK via Visual Studio Installer

**Application starts but window is blank**
- Ensure your GPU supports DirectX 11

**Tests fail to build**
- GoogleTest is fetched automatically; ensure internet connection during first build
